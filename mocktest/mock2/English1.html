	 (A) the idea of official paternity leave has been introduced to give fathers the right to take paid time off work following the birth (or adoption) of a child.<br> (B) Recently, the Captain of the Indian cricket team has asked for and was granted, paternity leave in the middle of a competitive Test series against Australia. <br>(C)Usually, in our country, leave at the time of birth of a new-born child is availed by women only. The battle against this deep-grained sexist skew in work and labour is a long haul. Hence,<br>(D) If governments and private companies take a minimum first step in acknowledging that parenting and childcare is the shared responsibility of both men and women, then it will be <br>(E)an important development in the context of gender discrimination at the workplace, and it will also have broader implications on the patriarchal mindset of Indian society.

	As much as Industry 4.0 - the collection of interlinked digital technologies enabling Machines to think for themselves and connect with each other – is worrying policymakers in advanced economies over job destruction, it is exciting policymakers in the developing world with the prospect of leapfrogging traditional industrial activities. But what policymakers everywhere need to take a closer look at is how these technologies lend themselves to rising monopoly power which, if unchallenged, will give a handful of giant corporations an ever greater say over future growth and employment prospects everywhere.“Creative destruction “ has always been a part of technological progress, whereby some businesses and practices are destroyed and others created, leading to long-term gains in productivity, incomes and jobs. However, industry 4.0 differs from previous revolutions in important ways. In earlier episodes – mechanisation, mass production, automation and electronics – the key inputs, whether cotton, iron, coal, or oil, had a tangible quality that, in combination with significant amounts of productive labour and dedicated managerial capabilities, anchored the process of adding (and distributing) value in a well defined network of spatial and social relations where public policies could shape the landscape of winners and losers.In digital revolution, the key input, which is “data “, is intangible, requires little labour to create value and the capital behind it is inherently foot loose.This has given rise to a world of disembodied networks and diminished bargaining power of those producing the input, particularly in developing countries where the laws and regulations over the ownership of data and the capacity to use it profitably are weak or missing altogether.In this world, first mover advantage is enjoyed by the digital giants (Amazon, Alibaba, Google, Facebook, et cetera) in collecting data allow them to use big data analytics to out compete smaller rivals and block potential rivals. The growth and operation of Uber – the world‘s biggest taxi service which owns no taxis – has exposed the vulnerability of national firms, especially in developing countries where infant platforms tend to receive little or no state support.
