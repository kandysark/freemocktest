	Among all available investment avenues, a fixed deposit(FD) remains the most favourite of people belonging to almost all the age groups in India, specially the senior citizens, despite the trend of lowering interest rates in the recent years. Presently, capital protection has become more important than capital appreciation for senior citizens. The interest rates provided in India under senior citizens fixed deposit, remain one of the main reasons along with the security and guaranteed returns it provides without any risk. Also, the account opening process for any FD is very simple in any of the banks or NBFCs. Fixed deposits in banks are easy to operate and highly liquid instruments offering higher interest rates (up to 0.5%) for senior citizen depositors.The senior citizens can also avail the benefit of monthly, quarterly, half yearly and annual interest payouts from a non-cumulative fixed deposit The senior citizens can also avail the benefit of monthly, quarterly, half yearly and annual interest payouts from a non-cumulative fixed deposit. Senior citizen depositors can open an FD with a bank offering higher rates after due diligence and risk assessment. Also, for taking the advantage of Government guarantee of the capital invested in banks, they can limit their deposits to Rs.5,00,00 per bank as that much amount is covered by the deposit insurance and credit guarantee( DICGC ). Besides, they can also split their corpus into multiple fixed deposits with different tenures to create an investment loop so that they can be benefited if the rates increase in the future. It is known as the fixed deposit laddering technique which also ensures high liquidity without the risk of losing interest income due to premature withdrawals in the face of a cash crunch situation . Easy loan facility against such deposit is also being provided by all the banks making it easier to have funds in case of an emergency at some extra cost.
